# Structure-Aware Human-Action Generation

We propose a variant of GCNs to leverage the powerful self-attention mechanism to adaptively sparsify a complete action graph in the temporal space. Our method could dynamically attend to important past frames and construct a sparse graph to apply in the GCN framework, well-capturing the structure information in action sequences. The paper can be found on arXiv. ECCV 2020 accepted.
